## World Cup Database

Create a Bash script that enters information from World Cup games into PostgreSQL, then query the database for useful statistics.

### Subtasks

- Create a database named `worldcup`
- **Connect to your worldcup database** and then create `teams` and `games` tables
- The `teams` table should have a `team_id` column that is a type of `SERIAL` and is the primary key, and a `name` column that has to be `UNIQUE`
- The `games` table should have a `game_id` column that is a type of `SERIAL` and is the primary key, a `year` column of type `INT`, and a `round` column of type `VARCHAR`
- The `games` table should have `winner_id` and `opponent_id` foreign key columns that each reference `team_id` from the `teams` table
- The `games` table should have `winner_goals` and `opponent_goals` columns that are type `INT`
- All of the columns should have the `NOT NULL` constraint
- The two script (`.sh`) files should have executable permissions. Other tests involving these two files will fail until permissions are correct. When these permissions are enabled, the tests will take significantly longer to run
- When you run your `insert_data.sh` script, it should add each unique team to the `teams` table. There should be 24 rows
- When you run your `insert_data.sh` script, it should insert a row for each line in the `games.csv` file (other than the top line of the file). There should be 32 rows. Each row should have every column filled in with the appropriate info. Make sure to add the correct ID's from the teams table (you cannot hard-code the values)
- Correctly complete the queries in the `queries.sh` file. Fill in each empty `echo` command to get the output of what is suggested with the command above it. Only use a single line like the first query. The output should match what is in the `expected_output.txt` file **exactly**, take note of the number of decimal places in some of the query results
